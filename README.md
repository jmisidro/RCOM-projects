`Projects developed as part of a Computer Networks course @FEUP`

## [First Project](Trabalho1/README.md)

`A data link layer protocol, with a simple file transfer application to test it`

### Goals

* Implement a data link layer protocol, according to the specification below
    - This protocol implements transmitter and receiver functionality to transfer a file stored on a computer hard disk between computers connected through a RS-232 serial cable 
    
* Develop a simple file transfer application transfer to test the protocol implemented


## [Second Project](Trabalho2/README.md)

`A download application for the FTP and the configuration and study of a computer network`

### Goals

* Develop a download application for the FTP
    - Understand the FTP and later use this application to analyse the computer network configured
    
* Configure and analyse a computer network
    - Through a series of experiments, develop a better understanding of the concepts of computer networks, compare and use the main technologies of the above-mentioned;
    - Implement, configure and evaluate key mechanisms and components of computer networks.
