`A data link layer protocol, with a simple file transfer application to test it`

### Goals

* Implement a data link layer protocol, according to the specification below
    - This protocol implements transmitter and receiver functionality to transfer a file stored on a computer hard disk between computers connected through a RS-232 serial cable 
    
* Develop a simple file transfer application transfer to test the protocol implemented
